 * Bank of IIT has contacted you to write, compile and execute 
 * a complete program that creates bank account information and
 * executes various transaction details for their clients. Your
 * program will prompt users for options such as creating an
 * initial balance, entering deposits or withdrawals. Also your
 * program will allow for the printing of account information
 * including interest at various interest rates. Use loops,
 * user defined methods, conditional and relational logic and
 * the basics of OOP to accomplish the objectives of this progam.
 * Error trapping will be part of your grade so donâ€™t forget 
 * to include some basic error trapping logic! Comment your 
 * code thoroughly as well for maximum points.
